give graphmaze a more concrete setting i.e. change its nodes from nodes to states, and allow those states to be accessible outside of gra[hmaze via iterators
paint only the player, paint the maze exclusively once
once we split the model apart from the maze more, drawing enemies/collectibles will be easier, simpler
